# Traffic-Data-Analysis
This was my semester project in Data Science. 

This project's goal is to investigate and evaluate the Kaggle dataset on traffic infractions. The dataset
includes a thorough history of traffic offences in Maryland, United States, from 2012 to 2018. The dataset
comprises of nearly 4 million observations and 35 variables, including data on the demographics of the
drivers, the features of the vehicles, and the specifics of the violations. Through this study, we hope to
understand the causes that contribute to traffic violations, identify the most frequent offences, and acquire
insights into the patterns and trends in traffic violations.
